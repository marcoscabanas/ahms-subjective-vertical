### SUBJECTIVE VERTICAL: ASSIGNMENT
Assignment on the perception of the subjective vertical based on otolith &amp; semi-circular canal inputs (NO visual inputs) - low and high frequency cases.

-- ASSIGNMENT INSTRUCTIONS --
1. Write a Python script to simulate how the subjective vertical changes.
2. No visual cues can be taken into account (ie: no visual attractor model).
3. Only use the subjective vertical model, as defined in the slides.
4. Two cases must be generated: One for low-frequency components @ 0.1 rad/sec., one for high-frequency components @ 5 rad/sec.
